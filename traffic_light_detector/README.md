In order to make this system work, I am planing to use an adaptation of the following code:

@ONLINE{cr,
    author = "Ahmet Özlü",
    title  = "Color Recognition",
    year   = "2018",
    url    = "https://github.com/ahmetozlu/color_recognition"
}

After the recognition of the darknet we use its segmentation and check the color
